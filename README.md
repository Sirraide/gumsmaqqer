# GUMSMAQQER
This is the GUMSMAQQER

**IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS**, ~~consider yourself lucky~~, look up ‘Agma Schwa’ on YouTube and search for 'Gumsmaq'.

## Emojis
You need the `assets` folder from https://github.com/twitter/twemoji  

Place that folder into the same directory as the gumsmaqqer executable. Alternatively, you can define the environment variable `GUMSMAQQER_ASSETS_DIR` and have it point to the `assets` folder.

## How to build from source
First, clone the repo. Then:

Linux: Run `./build.sh`.\
Windows:\* Use Visual Studio.

Keep in mind that there are releases for a reason. The git version is not guaranteed to compile!

\*You will get warnings on Windows because Windows is Windows. Also, this project uses a shared library, so er, good luck!
